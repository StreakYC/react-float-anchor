## 3.4.0 (2019-10-22)

* Added support for passing an HTMLElement as the `anchor` prop.

## 3.3.0 (2019-10-22)

* The choice return value from contain-by-screen is now available if you pass a callback as the `float` prop.

## 3.2.0 (2019-10-15)

* Added the `parentElement` prop.

## 3.1.0 (2019-03-28)

* Added the `repositionAsync()` method to FloatAnchor. This method should generally be used instead of `reposition()` because it allows multiple queued repositions to be coalesced together.
* Fixed multiple O(n^2) issues with nested FloatAnchors that caused them to be repositioned redundantly when the outer FloatAnchors were repositioned.
* Fixed `autoFocus` prop not working on input elements and similar components inside of a floated element. The float element container div is now added to the page body before any of the float elements' componentDidMount methods are called.

## 3.0.0 (2018-10-30)

### Breaking Changes
* React v16.6.0+ is now required.
* The `anchor` prop must be a function of anchorRef => React node now.

FloatAnchor v2:

```js
<FloatAnchor
  anchor={
    <div>a</div>
  }
/>
```

FloatAnchor v3:

```js
<FloatAnchor
  anchor={anchorRef =>
    <div ref={anchorRef}>a</div>
  }
/>
```

### Improvements
* Removed all usages of the deprecated method
  [React.findDOMNode](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#finddomnode).
* No longer uses the legacy [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#legacy-api).
* Both `anchor` and `float` props may now use any React node rather than only a
  React element. (You can pass a string now.)
